-- DATA CLEANING

STEPS
-- 1. Remove Duplicates 
-- 2. Standardized the Data
-- 3. Null values/Blank Values 
-- 4. Remove any columns

-- 1. Creating two seperate tables, as I am going to change the data a lot, always good to have the raw data in one table unchanged in case you make a mistake. 

CREATE TABLE layoffs_staging
LIKE layoffs;

SELECT * 
FROM layoffs_staging;

INSERT layoffs_staging
SELECT *
FROM layoffs;



-- 1. Remove Duplicates 

SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER( 
PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, 'date', stage, country, funds_raised_millions) AS row_num
FROM layoffs_staging;

WITH duplicate_cte AS 
(
SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER( 
PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, (date), stage, country, funds_raised_millions) AS row_num
FROM layoffs_staging
)

SELECT *
FROM duplicate_cte
WHERE row_num > 1;

DELETE 
FROM duplicate_cte
WHERE row_num > 1;

-- SELECT *
-- FROM layoffs_staging
-- WHERE company = 'Casper';
-- Check each company has a duplicate




-- 2. Standardized the Data

SELECT company, TRIM(company)
FROM layoffs_staging;

UPDATE layoffs_staging
SET company = TRIM(company);

-- SELECT DISTINCT industry
-- FROM layoffs_staging
-- ORDER BY 1;

UPDATE layoffs_staging
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry LIKE 'Crypto%';

SELECT INDUSTRY
FROM layoffs_staging
ORDER BY 1;

-- SELECT DISTINCT location
-- FROM layoffs_staging
-- ORDER BY 1;

-- SELECT DISTINCT country
-- FROM layoffs_staging
-- WHERE country LIKE 'United States%'
-- ORDER BY 1;

-- SELECT DISTINCT country, TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country)
-- FROM layoffs_staging
-- ORDER BY 1;

-- UPDATE layoffs_staging
-- SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country)
-- WHERE country LIKE 'United States%';

SELECT `date`,
STR_TO_DATE (`date`, '%m/%d/%Y') 
FROM layoffs_staging;

UPDATE layoffs_staging
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE (`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging
MODIFY column `date` DATE;


-- 3. Null values/Blank Values 

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging;

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging
WHERE industry IS NULL
OR industry = '';

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging
WHERE company = 'Airbnb';

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging t1
JOIN layoffs_staging t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
WHERE (t1.industry IS NULL OR t1.industry = '')
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

UPDATE layoffs_staging t1
JOIN layoffs_staging t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE (t1.industry IS NULL OR t1.industry = '')
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;


-- 4. Remove any columns

SELECT * 
FROM layoffs_staging
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL 
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

DELETE  
FROM layoffs_staging
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL 
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging
