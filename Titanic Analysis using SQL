-- I've utilized Titanic data to extract insights. 
-- The queries delve into various aspects such as survival rates, demographic distributions, and fare analysis.
-- By examining passenger information, including age, class, and gender, these SQL commands aim to unravel intriguing patterns within the historic Titanic dataset.

USE titanic_project;

-- 1. Show the first 10 rows of the dataset.

SELECT * 
FROM titanic 
ORDER BY PassengerId
DESC limit 10;


-- 2. Find the number of passengers who survived 

SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Passengers_survived" 
FROM titanic 
WHERE Survived = 1 ;


-- 3. Find the average age of all passengers.

SELECT avg(age) 
FROM titanic;


-- 4. Find the number of passengers in each class.

SELECT Pclass,count(*) AS "No_of_passengers" 
FROM titanic 
GROUP BY Pclass;


-- 5. Find the first 10 rows of the dataset sorted by passenger class in descending order.

SELECT * 
FROM titanic 
ORDER BY Pclass 
DESC LIMIT 10;


-- 6. Find the number of passengers in each class sorted by class in ascending order.


SELECT Pclass, count(*) 
FROM titanic GROUP BY Pclass 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC;



-- 7. Find the average fare paid by passengers in each class.

SELECT Pclass,AVG(Fare) AS "avg_fare" 
FROM titanic GROUP BY Pclass;


-- 8. Find the name of the passenger with the highest fare.

SELECT name,Fare 
FROM titanic 
WHERE fare = (SELECT MAX(Fare) FROM titanic);

SELECT MAX(Fare) 
FROM titanic

-- 9. Find the name of the passenger who had the highest age among the survivors.
SELECT name,age 
FROM titanic 
WHERE age= (SELECT MAX(age) 
FROM titanic 
WHERE Survived = 1)
AND Survived =1;

SELECT MAX(age) 
FROM titanic
WHERE Survived = 1


-- 10. Find the number of passengers who paid more than the average fare.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_passengers 
FROM titanic WHERE Fare > (SELECT AVG(Fare) FROM titanic);

SELECT AVG(Fare) 
FROM titanic;


-- 12. Find the number of male and female passengers who survived, 
-- and order the results by sex in ascending order:

SELECT Sex,count(*) AS num_survived 
FROM titanic WHERE Survived = 1
GROUP by Sex 
ORDER by Sex ASC;
